The current sensor will detect the volume of the current leakage and compare it with the pre-set value, if the current leakage exceeds the permitted range, the RCD will disconnect the inverter from the AC load.

An external residual current protection device is not needed. If the local regulation demands otherwise, it is recommended to install a **30mA Type B** residual current protection device.

## Smart Meter Installation


A smart meter can be installed externally to provide a solution of Zero-injection (also known as: anti-reflux, zero feed-in) function. It is a function that the inverter automatically adjusts the Output Power to  match the real-time consumption power of loads in the system. Therefore, the system will not feed any energy to the grid.

## Pre-Commissioning Safety Checklist

Before closing the inverter’s DC Switch and switching on any voltage resources connected to the inverter, please check the conformity of your PV system to the following:

1. Grid Voltage

- [ ] Check at points of connection if the grid voltage complies with permitted range of the inverter.

2. Mounting Bracket
- [ ] Check if the mounting bracket is properly and securely installed to a solid surface.
3. Installation / Mounting
- [ ] Check if the inverter is properly mounted to the surface and securely attached to the mounting bracket.
4. DC Connections
- [ ] Check if DC connectors provided are assembled correctly and connected safely to the inverter.
- [ ] Check if DC connectors have the correct polarity (+ and -) and are allocated to the correct terminals (+ and -, MPPT1 and MPPT2, etc.).
- [ ] Check if the peak value of PV open-circuit voltage complies within the inverter’s permitted range.

5. AC Connections

- [ ] Check if wires (L, N & PE) are safely assembled inside the AC connector is assembled correctly.

- [ ] Check if the AC connector is properly assembled, and swivel nuts are securely tightened.

- [ ] Check if the AC connector is firmly plugged into AC terminal.

6. Electrical Wires

- [ ] Check if all wires are reliably connected.

- [ ] Check if all established connections are working and effective, while insulation of wires are undamaged.

7. Groundings

- [ ] Check all groundings using a megger or a multimeter.

- [ ] Check if all exposed metal parts of the inverter are properly grounded.

8. Grounding Resistance

- [ ] Check if the grounding resistance of PV strings >200kΩ using a megger or a multimeter.

## Add the device to HiPortal

The procedure is to add the device (Datalogger and the inverter) into a new plant or existing plant in HiPortal virtually. It is only available if Datalogger is included in the package.  If not, skip this section or consult with your provider to make a purchase.

When the inverter is connected with a communication device (e.g. Wi-Fi Stick, GPRS Stick, Ethernet Stick, HiManager), the device is the unit for configuration of your entire PV system/plant.

The inverter does not require initial configuration to operate once installed and commissioned.

All inverters are compatible with HiPortal monitoring platform. Connection to HiPortal is highly recommended for [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) purposes.

Commands of configuration are transferred to connected inverter units in the system, which then overwrites the settings of inverter. Malfunctions caused by unauthorized alterations of inverter settings will void guarantee and warranty terms.

## Starting the Self-Test (for Italy only)

 <img src="https://i.loli.net/2020/12/18/Kjuqr43seaWD1yJ.png" width = 1080/>

> Configuration of Safety Standard overwrites the inverter’s key parameters of grid connection and protections.
> The Safety Standard of the inverter therefore must be set correctly.
> A Safety Standard not applicable for your country and purposes may induce a disturbance in the PV system.

<hr>

The self-test is a required function for inverters that feed into the grid in Italy by the standard of CEI 0-21. During the self-test, the inverter will consecutively check the reaction times for over-voltage, under-voltage, maximum frequency and minimum frequency.

The product described in this document is equipped with the self-test function when the grid standard of the inverter is opted to CEI.

After the self-test has been completed, the inverter automatically switches back to feed-in operation and resets the original disconnection conditions and connects to the grid. The test takes 3 minutes on average.

Inverters shipped for qualified Italian distributorship is set on default to the Safety Standard of CEI 0-21 and requires no further configuration.

**Requirements:**

The Safety Standard of the inverter must be set to CEI 0-21 internal.

**Procedure:**

2. First line of LCD displays “Auto Testing” and the second line of LCD displays “Start”. Release the button for more than 10s, LCD will automatically switch to display the information about testing. 
3. If auto test is finished, short press the button, second line of LCD switches between “Start” and “Result”. Under the “Result” display interface then release the button for more than 10s, LCD will automatically switch to display the result of auto test. Short pressing the button displays test result one by one. 
4. Auto test begin after the inverter relays close successfully. And LCD shows the information about testing. If sub test finishes and second line of LCD displays “Test  OK”. The first line of LCD displays voltage or frequency test value and the value of protection time. Inverter relay breaks off and reconnect to grid automatically according to CEI 0-21 requirement. Then the next test starts. Test order is 81>.S1(maximum over frequency), 81>.S2(maximum over frequency), 81<.S1(minimum under frequency), 81<.S2(minimum under frequency), 59.S1(maximum voltage over 10min), 59.S2(maximum over voltage), 27.S1(minimum under voltage), 27.S2(minimum under voltage).
