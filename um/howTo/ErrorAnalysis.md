# Overview

The purpose of this document is:

- To provide systematic method to locate failures and errors within the PV system.
- To provide effective counter-measures to correspondence problems.

It is recommended that you contact **Hypontech** in time and provide necessary field measured data if solutions mentioned below have been tested ineffective.

> <b>DANGER to life due to HIGH VOLTAGES</b>
> The voltage generated by PV module can be as high as serval hundred volts. Touching DC side components or related circuits may cause electric shock.

---

**Please ensure that:**

* Inverter maintenance must be performed by qualified personnel only in compliance with national and local standards and regulations.
* During the operation on inverters, **DO** make sure to disconnect both the AC and DC power supply and wait for at least 5 minutes until the energy storage components are fully discharged.
* Do not touch any live components.

# Other Possible Problems

* Does the ambient temperature of the installation position meet with the installation requirements of the inverter?

* Has the inverter panel been removed? Is the screw tight after restoration? Is the sealant strip of the panel intact?

* For multiple PV input terminals, are the terminals without PV modules covered with insulation sealing covers?

* When the DC conjunction box is connected to the inverter, does the current meet the requirements of the inverter?
